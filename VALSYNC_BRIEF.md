## Brand

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Personality** | Tactical. Understated. Earnest. |
| **Design North Star** | "The Tactical Readout" — a HUD that earns its place mid-match. |
| **Anti-references** | No esports neon (BLITZ.gg), no corporate SaaS cream (Monday.com), no glassmorphism, no AD-heavy trackers. |
| **Voice** | Player-native language. Privacy is visible immediately. Trust before conversion. |

---

## Product Philosophy

1. **Readout, not billboard** — information first, decoration never competes.
2. **Privacy is visible** — the no-ads/no-tracking promise is surfaced immediately and repeatedly.
3. **Tactical restraint** — every color, line, and animation earns its place in a mid-match context.
4. **Player-native language** — copy feels made by people who play Valorant.
5. **Trust before conversion** — credibility signals sit beside the download CTA.
6. **Dark-first** — never light-by-default. A Radiant player checks their companion app late at night.

## Competitive Positioning

VALSYNC differentiates from:
- **BLITZ.gg / Porofessor.gg** — No esports neon, no glow gradients, no ad inventory.
- **OP.GG** — No table-heavy stat sprawl, no banner ads.
- **Generic SaaS** — No pastel cream/blue, no corporate rhythm.
- **Ad-first "free" apps** — Zero banners, zero tracking, zero data brokerage.

**Core differentiator**: Privacy is the product, not a compliance page.
